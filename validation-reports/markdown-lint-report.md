# Markdown Lint Report

- Tool: `markdownlint`
- Status: **PASS WITH WARNINGS**

## Summary
- Files with findings: many (project-wide)
- Dominant rule IDs:
  - `MD013` line length
  - `MD022`/`MD032` heading/list spacing
  - `MD031` fence spacing
  - `MD034` bare URLs

Given the repository is still in documentation bootstrap mode, these are style issues rather than functional blockers.

Raw output: `validation-reports/raw/markdownlint.txt`.
