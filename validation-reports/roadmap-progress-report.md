# Roadmap Progress Report

- Status: **PASS WITH WARNINGS**

## Week 1-2 Snapshot
Repository contents show most foundational artifacts already exist (governance docs, schemas, ADRs, workflows, legal docs).

## Notable gaps vs roadmap/checklists
- Several Week 2 build/hardening docs are referenced but not yet implemented.
- Multiple roadmap checkboxes in `ROADMAP.md` still show unchecked despite files already existing.

## Recommendation
Update Week 1 checkbox states in `ROADMAP.md` to reflect current repository state and reduce tracking drift.
