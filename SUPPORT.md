## Community Support

### GitHub Discussions (Recommended)

**Best for**: General questions, usage help, feature discussions, showcasing projects.

**Categories**:
- **Q&A**: Ask questions, get help from the community
- **Show & Tell**: Share your KYNEĒ deployments or use cases (with proper authorization!)
- **Ideas**: Suggest new features or improvements

**Response Time**: Community-driven, usually within 24-48 hours.

### GitHub Issues

**Best for**: Bug reports, feature requests (with clear specifications).

[https://github.com/zebadee2kk/kynee/issues](https://github.com/zebadee2kk/kynee/issues)

**Before Opening an Issue**:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use the appropriate template (Bug Report or Feature Request)
3. Provide as much detail as possible (logs, configs, environment)
4. **Redact sensitive information** (IPs, credentials, client names)

## Expected Behavior

When seeking support:

✅ **Do**:
- Be respectful and patient
- Provide context (what you tried, what failed, error logs)
- Redact sensitive information
- Search before asking
- Follow up if your issue is resolved (close or comment)

❌ **Don't**:
- Demand immediate responses (this is a volunteer project)
- Ask for help with illegal activities (see [ETHICAL_USE_POLICY.md](ETHICAL_USE_POLICY.md))
- Cross-post the same question in multiple channels
- Share proprietary client information

## Response Time Expectations

| Channel | Typical Response | Priority |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Security vulnerability | 48 hours | Critical |
| Bug report (critical) | 2-5 days | High |
| Bug report (non-critical) | 1-2 weeks | Medium |
| Feature request | 2-4 weeks | Low |
| General question (Discussions) | 1-3 days | Medium |

**Note**: These are community-driven estimates, not SLAs. For guaranteed response times, consider professional support (when available).
